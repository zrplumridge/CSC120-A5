helps with organization
plan out the scarecrow first!


Association helps to separate the program into parts. This can make testing individual parts possible prior to running the entire program, and therefore allows for easier debugging. It does, however, mean that there are usually more steps to make sure that the various classes can communicate the right information to each other in the right way. 

For this program, it was pretty important to plan out the appearance of the scarecrow and how to break it into pieces before beginning programming. Pieces are often easier to work on because they are less overwhelming. 

Joanna Li helped me with the command line interaction, which was temporarily not working on VSCode.
